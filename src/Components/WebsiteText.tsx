            <p style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"center"}}>
                Our goal is to help CISC students plan out their semesters 
                by providing templates of potential Fall/Spring semesters, 
                and even Winter and Summer!</p>

            <p style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"center"}}>
                This website will serve as a way for students to keep track of the 
                classes they have taken and which ones they need to take next.</p>

            <p style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"center"}}>
                Students will get the option to remove a semester 
                if they are not pleased with their schedule</p>

            <p style={{display: "flex", justifyContent:"center"}}>
                Students will be able to edit in classes in case 
                our default schedules dont match theirs</p>
